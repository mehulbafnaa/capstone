It then introduces a hypothesis h1 that states that (\u2211 k in Finset.Icc (1 : \u2115) 1319, (-1) ^ (k + 1) * ((1 : \u211d) / k)) = p / q.

This proof uses the same tactics as the previous proof, but it does not use the substitution theorem.This proof is a bit more concise than the previous proof, and it does not use the substitution theorem.
